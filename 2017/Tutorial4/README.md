## Q1: Humour explained

Why are the following sentences (supposed to be) funny? Explain with your newfound knowledge of lexical semantics.

* The fancy name for the phenomenon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeugma_and_syllepsis

* The word *inlict* is more commonly used for acts of violence or disease, and thus using it in the context of naming a child is meant to be humorous (and also reveal what the speaker thinks of the name).

* Homonymy, but not homophony; only works in written.

Some picks of your examples:

> “Why do francophones eat only one egg for breakfast?”  “Because one egg is *un oeuf*”

> (Conversation between A and B, on the topic of A wanting to own horses in the future. B's reply:)
“It will at least have to wait until you are in a more stable situation.”

> “Come to the nerd side, we have pi”
