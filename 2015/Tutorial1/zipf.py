    # we use the helper function `snd' as the key
    # example data in top_freqs: [("the",500), ("a",450), ...]

    # 1st line: create a range from 1 to amount of tokens: e.g. 1-6132
    # 2nd line: for each (word,freq) pair in top_freqs, get the word
    # 3rd line: for each (word,freq) pair in top_freqs, get the freq

    # simply divide the highest frequency by the rank.
    # e.g. the expected frequency for the 315st ranked word is
    #     highest_freq
    #     ------------

    # e.g. zip(['a','b'], [1,2]) returns [('a',1), ('b',2)].
